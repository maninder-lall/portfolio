            <p>The AirBnb project was a great opportunity to create a dynamic clone that matches a known website.</p>
            <img src="img/airbnb_banner.png" alt = "">
            <p>It served as the foundation blocks for my interest in developing in REACT. It was a great challenge to try and re-create a website from scratch, not even initally having various assets used by the developers. One of the hardest challenges was to pin-point the small hard to notice details. This could be spacing between various components, or even something simple as the weight of a font.</p>
            <p>The website is a static page, but it adapts with new data presented. As new data is inserted into the data file, REACT will automatically map the data to an object. Then create a card component using the data.</p>
            <img src="img/airbnb_cards.png" alt = "">
            <p>The following is the data that was used to create the 3 cards shown in the image above:</p>
            <img src="img/airbrb_data.png" alt = "">
            <p>This project served as a great exercise for reinforcing my knowledge on REACT and particularly making use of reusable components. It also helped reinforced my ability to gather information, and replicate using my knowledge.</a></p>
